Background
The client has a massive Google Drive that is filled with medicolegal-related files (word documents, spreadsheets, etc). These are organized in different folders where only certain users can access them (the owner of the case).
We need to be able to somehow retrieve those files from Google Drive and have them as attachments to Case (custom object) records in HubSpot.
Task
Demo an automated solution where files can be retrieved from Google Drive and set as attachments to HubSpot records (a contact, company, deal, or ticket record will do).
The files must be attached to the correct record. E.g. if a file in GDrive is for johndoe@gmail.com, then the file should only be attached to John Doeâ€™s HubSpot contact record.
Create a google doc and propose your solution, A recorded video explanation would be helpful
